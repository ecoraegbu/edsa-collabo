Intro Navigating the command prompt or shell
cmd, pwd, cd, mkdir, rm/rmdir, dir/ls, cp, mv,

A. Create a repository from scratch
	`git init`
B. Clone an existing repository
	url = https://github.com/ecoraegbu/edsa-collabo.git
	`git clone`, cloning with alias,
C. Determine the status of a repository
	`git status`
D. Check working History 
	command = `git log`

	Navigating the log
	to scroll down, press 
	j or ‚Üì to move down one line at a time
	d to move by half the page screen
	f to move by a whole page screen

	To scroll up, press
	k or ‚Üë to move _up_ one line at a time
	u to move by half the page screen
	b to move by a whole page screen

	To quit
	press q to quit out of the log (returns to the regular command prompt)

	Information gotten from the log includes
	the SHA
	the author
	the date
	and the message
	
	Using the oneline flag to change the way the log displays
	`git log --oneline`
	git online command will do the following
	lists one commit per line
	shows the first 7 characters of the commit's SHA
	shows the commit's message
E. Check modified files
	`git log --stat`
	--stat will give the following information
	displays the file(s) that have been modified
	displays the number of lines that have been added/removed
	displays a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that have been added/removed

F. Viewing file changes
	`git log --patch | git log --p`
	
	Information gotten from git log --patch flag include the following

	üîµ - the file that is being displayed
	üî∂ - the hash of the first version of the file and the hash of the second version of the file
	not usually important, so it's safe to ignore
	‚ù§Ô∏è - the old version and current version of the file
	üîç - the lines where the file is added and how many lines there are
	-15,83 indicates that the old version (represented by the -) started at line 15 and that the file had 83 lines
	+15,85 indicates that the current version (represented by the +) starts at line 15 and that there are now 85 lines...
	these 85 lines are shown in the patch below
	‚úèÔ∏è - the actual changes made in the commit
	lines that are red and start with a minus (-) were in the original version of the file but have been removed by the commit
	lines that are green and start with a plus (+) are new lines that have been added in the commit

G. Viewing specific commits
	`git show` used with SHA eg. `git show fdf5493`
	Information gotten from the git show command includes
	the commit
	the author
	the date
	the commit message
	the patch information


	However, git show can be combined with most of the other flags we've looked at:
	--stat - to show the how many files were changed and the number of lines that were added/removed
	-p or --patch - this the default, but if --stat is used, the patch won't display, so pass -p to add it again
	-w - to ignore changes to whitespace


H. Adding commits to Repository
	git add: The git add command is used to move files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index
	usage: git add filename | git add .(for all)
	run the git status command here to see the files added to the staging index.
	to remove files from the staging index use the -rm flag. git rm --cached | git rm --cached <filename>
