suggestions:	The text file on "some basic git commands" was very helpful

suggestions:	The "some basic git commands" file was a great resource; 
		i will suggest we update it with definition of those navigation 
		commands. It will also be great to contain ground up description
		of how to begin working with git. I initially struggled with 
		cloning the repo.
