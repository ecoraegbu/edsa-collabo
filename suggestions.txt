suggestions:	The "some basic git commands" file was a great resource; 
		i will suggest we update it with definition of those navigation 
		commands. It will also be great to contain ground up description
		of how to begin working with git. I initially struggled with 
		cloning the repo.

Suggestions: I strongly recommend sharing of ideas and materials.
             Updating the "Basic git commands" sheet with its definitions and functionality.
             Simplified way of teaching to ensure beginners are carried along as well.
             Tasking us to do real time practical-(test) after every coaching session.

Suggestions: I will suggest we find a way to record our meeting. It has a way of helping to
	     keep tabs with developments.
	     Also, we can create a form of reporting system that helps to track progress on projects
             Finally, the document attached is a great resource. Kudos to the team. Though additions
	     can be made about how to use git fetch, pull and checkout. I will be glad to have some inputs concerning that.
	     Thanks

Suggestions: 	To ensure effective communication during meetings, visual thinking tools are a MUST have
		as they play important roles in ideation, workflow and collaboration. 
		The use of virtual whiteboard such as miro would come in handy.
		Also there should be decentralization of ideas as we proceed. In other words, ideas should
		not just flow in and from one direction in our forth coming projects.
